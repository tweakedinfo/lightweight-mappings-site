  |### A quick note...
  |
  |To avoid spamming your repository with my images, I've removed the images from the images folder.
  |
  |That means those images won't load, but I've left the code in as a sample for *how* to load them.
  |
  |Likewise, your repository probably doesn't have the same courses I showed in this deck. So those
  |won't load either, but I've left the code in as an example

  |
  |### Mostly this is markedown
  |
  |In 2020, introducing the Diploma of IT in the pandemic while down on staff, I built a kit that
  |let my build interactive OERs quickly.
  |
  |Mostly, these decks are markdown, but we can also include interactive stuff
  |
  |e.g. 
  |
  |- https://theintelligentbook.com/circuitsup/#/latches/0/0
  |- https://theintelligentbook.com/thinkingaboutprogramming/#/decks/state/4/fullscreen
  |
  |
  |[Veautiful / Doctacular](http://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful)
  |
  |and I'd had some code to map our units, in order to ensure that all our course plans and pre-reqs worked,
  |which I'd used since 2017ish
  |
  |So (spoiler) we'll get to a set of mappings built so they can be sketched and shown easily 
  |in interactive decks and sites

  |### Maps bring the burden of creation
  |
  |Across several degrees, I had to do a lot of maps. This is only feasible if there's an easy way to do it.
  |
  | - We're the computer science discipline; so I built one.
  | - Maps are a visualisation, so I built it using the same kit I used to write this deck.
  |
  |Very fast edit cycle
  | - tweak the course/unit data and hit reload.
  | - this has let us use this as a **design tool** and embed it into course presentations (and this talk!)
  |

  |
  |### Conclusion
  |
  |* Swiss Cheese modelling - modelling the identity verification mechanisms across a degree
  |
  |* Keeping lightweight maps that are not in the governance process, but snapshots in time
  |
  |(and maps are visualisations so don't draw them; generate them.)
